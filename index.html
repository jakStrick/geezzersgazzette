            B. Franklin understood some shit we seem to have lost sight of
            today. He understood that our Republic requires an educated and
            engaged citizenry—geezzers and all, to survive. Today, we face a
            crisis of civic knowledge that a couple of geezzers hope to bring
            back. Just two old guys who've watched too much TV and watched this
            country devolve while we were too busy having fun, but today we feel
            we still have some thoughts to share and hope to still be relevant.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>This blog exists to learn:</strong> Here, two geezzers
            explore the mechanics of American government—the three branches,
            their checks and balances, and how they work. Our goal is to make
            these complex systems understandable through plain language and
            geezzers' analysis.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What you'll find here:</strong> Geezzers examination of
            current events from two geezzers' perspectives, we remember how
            things were before, in hopes we can learn from the past.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What you won't find here:</strong> Hate speech, personal
            attacks, or conspiracy theories. We can disagree about geezzer stuff
            civilly. We've been disagreeing with each other for decades but
            still manage to be friends.
          </p>

          <p class="mission-cta">
            Whether you're a political newcomer or a fellow old-timer, join a
            couple geezzers talking about things they can remember. Because
            understanding our system isn't just academic—it's essential to
            preserving it for everyone.

            <h3>Article II Presidential Powers</h3>
            <p>
              The Constitution grants the President certain enumerated powers in
              Article II of the Constitution, and of those powers are the roles
              of Commander in Chief, the authority to ensure laws are faithfully
              executed, and to protect the United States from all enemies,
              foreign and domestic. 

              <P><strong>Geezzers' Take:</strong> In order for a president to faithfully protect the United States from all enemies foreign and domestic they need to protect the border ... if a president can't control the border of his own country, then how can he know who is entering or who is leaving? This would make it impossible for him to execute this power and it's plain common sense to have it shutdown. A president must have the authority and the tools to protect the nation.</P>

				Trump's approach has been true to the constitution in this regard. The border is indisputably shutdown... no one is coming or leaving without permission and everyone coming or leaving is now being accounted for on all sides of our nation N, S, E, and W.</P>
            </p>

            <h3>Key Examples of Executive Action</h3>
            <p>
              Through executive orders, administrative appointments, and
              regulatory reforms, the current administration has reshaped
              federal policy within existing legal frameworks. The use of recess
              appointments, emergency declarations, and executive privilege
              claims all fall within historical precedent, though their
              frequency and scope merit examination.
            </p>

            <h3>Checks and Balances in Action</h3>
            <p>
              What's particularly instructive is how the system of checks and
              balances continues to function. Congressional oversight, judicial
              review, and federalism all serve as counterweights to executive
              power, exactly as Madison envisioned in Federalist No. 51.
            </p>

            <p>
              This analysis isn't about whether one agrees with these policies,
              but rather understanding how our constitutional system operates
              when a president fully exercises their lawful authority. It's a
              masterclass in executive power that every citizen should
              understand, regardless of political affiliation.

                  Interesting analysis. The comparison to historical uses of
                  executive orders by previous presidents would add valuable
                  context. Lincoln, FDR, and Obama all tested these boundaries
                  in different ways.

                  The Youngstown Steel case (1952) established the framework for
                  analyzing presidential power. Trump's actions seem to fall
                  within Category 1 - acting with Congressional authorization -
                  in most instances.

              New York City's current political leadership represents a case
              study in how local governance can serve as a testing ground for
              broader ideological movements aimed at fundamentally restructuring
              the relationship between citizens and government.
            </p>

            <h3>The Progressive Blueprint</h3>
            <p>
              Recent policy initiatives in NYC - from housing regulations to
              business mandates to wealth redistribution proposals - reflect a
              coherent vision of expanded government authority over private
              economic decisions. These aren't isolated policies but part of a
              systematic approach to increase public sector control.
            </p>

            <h3>Historical Parallels and Differences</h3>
            <p>
              While progressive politics have deep roots in New York, the
              current approach differs from previous reform movements. Where
              earlier progressives focused on regulating excesses while
              preserving market mechanisms, today's movement questions the
              fundamental premises of private property and individual economic
              freedom.
            </p>

            <h3>National Implications</h3>
            <p>
              NYC has historically served as an incubator for national political
              movements. Understanding what's happening there - and the
              constitutional questions it raises about federalism, property
              rights, and individual liberty - is essential for anticipating
              potential national trends.
            </p>

            <p>
              This isn't about demonizing different political philosophies but
              rather clearly understanding their implications for our
              constitutional republic and the balance between collective action
              and individual freedom that has defined American governance.

                  As someone living in NYC, I see both the benefits and
                  drawbacks of these policies daily. The rent stabilization
                  helps many, but small businesses are struggling with
                  compliance costs.

                  The tension between state/local experimentation and federal
                  constitutional limits is fascinating. The Supreme Court's
                  dormant commerce clause jurisprudence may become very relevant
                  here.
