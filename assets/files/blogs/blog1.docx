Geezzer 1 ask—Is your mind for rent?

When a system demands more of your time and money to keep itself alive, it’s not just your wallet on the line—it’s your freedom of thought. Socialism thrives on control: the government decides, you comply, and your hard-earned income becomes the rent you pay for someone else’s vision. That’s not choice; that’s coercion.

A free market, on the other hand, lets you own your decisions, your labor, and your future. No forced buy-in. No ideological landlord. Just opportunity.
So ask yourself—are you willing to rent out your mind, or do you want to own it?
