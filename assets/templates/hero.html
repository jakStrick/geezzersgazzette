				B. Franklin understood some shit we seem to have lost sight of
				today. He understood that a Republic requires an educated and
				engaged citizenry—geezzers and all to survive. Today, we face a
				crisis of certain civic knowledge that a couple of geezzers hope to
				help restore. Yup, just two old geezzers who've watched too much TV,
				played one too many video games, drank too much wine, coffee,
				whiskey and sat back and watched this country devolve into a crap
				fest while we were too busy having fun. But lucky for you, we feel
				we still have some thoughts-- our geezzer ideas, to share and hope
				to still be relevant.

				<strong>Geezzers' Warning:</strong> One of the easiest ways for a
				politician to get your vote is to promise you things for free. Think
				about it... why wouldn't it be? And have you ever asked yourself
				what does "free" really mean? Who's paying for all this free stuff?
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>This blog exists to learn:</strong> Here, two geezzers
				(Geezzers 1 and 2) explore the mechanics of American government our
				constitutional republic—the three branches, their checks and
				balances, and how they work. Our goal is to make these complex
				systems understandable through plain language and geezzers'
				analysis.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What you'll find here:</strong> In an effort to educate you
				youngens, we provide some explanation of our constitutional
				republic. Examination of current political events by the two
				geezzers, and we try to remember how things used to be in hopes we
				can provide some context, insight and balance to the world around us
				to help put things into perspective.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What you won't find here:</strong> Hate speech, personal
				attacks, or conspiracy theories (like QAnon, Kings and TDS etc.). We
				can disagree about geezzer stuff civilly. We've been disagreeing
				with each other since Adam and Eve but still remain cordial.
			</p>

			<p class="mission-cta">
				Whether you're a political newcomer or a fellow old-timer, join a
				couple geezzers talking about things they can remember. Because
				understanding our constitutional republic isn't just academic—it's
				essential to preserving it for everyone.
